## Course Software Development Academy
I was pleased to participate in the "Python from Basics" course organized by the Software Development Academy. The course consists of over 300 hours of classes, and I devote many hours a week to independent work, thanks to which I gained knowledge on the following topics:
* Python: Python Basics, Python Technology, Python Intermediate, Algorithms and Data Structures,
* Testing and good practices: Software testing and TDD, Design patterns and good practices,
* Databases: SQL databases, Databases - programming.
* Frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
* Django

## Git and HTTP
During the course, I learned not only to program, but also developed my skills in many directions, including:
* I learned to work with the GIT tool (and Gitlab),
* I learned the basics of REST API and network tools, so that in my future work, I will be able to provide support during the back-end debugging process.

## Software Testing
I know that modern projects should not only be characterized by a well-designed, scalable and easily maintainable architecture, but also should be properly tested at the level of unit and integration tests. I learned to test my own code, which saved me a lot of time while developing my projects.
